What Wodehouse would call a \"concatenation of circumstances\" had occurred, and it meant that I marked my arrival to the New World by being cataclysmically sick mere metres(2) after I stepped off the plane.(3)</p> <ol> <li>a fairly brisk trot, as opposed to the more languid walk employed by most expats</li> <li>still on the metric system, thank god</li> <li>that's right, I couldn't even make it to the nearest washroom</li> </ol> <p>I blame the fish served on the plane, my mother on the other hand says this is how I lay announce my arrival to inhabitants of foreign lands. Both of us have sufficient empirical evidence to buttress our claims - I know that fish have never been great fans of my gut; I also know that several new-to-me places have had the good fortune of being decorated with the contents of my stomach(1). In any case, the 18-hour plane ride was not comfortable, I was unable to sample any of the food Singapore Airlines is famous for (apart from the fish of course), and I arrived at my sister's(2) apartment a sweaty, dehydrated husk of a man.</p> <ol> <li>A screening of Koi Mil Gaya (2003), Simla (2004), Shillong (2009), Ladakh (2017)</li> <li>her name is Srishti</li> </ol> <p>You know when you think you know what a term means, and then someone conducts a demo for you, and only then do you truly internalise what the term truly means? Well, my arrival was God's way of demonstrating to me why the word \"projectile\" is present in the term \"projectile vomiting\".</p> <p>Anyway, moving on. By this time in an article about arriving at a new place, writers of a certain variety would have used the next few paragraphs to describe their interaction with the fairly chatty taxi driver who drove them, and tried to draw a nice pithy conclusion about the state of the world from the said interaction. Yours truly, however, was, a) driven by a driver who didn't say a single word throughout the ride, and b) was taught statistics by the formidable Rosie Ching, so he knows what happens when one tries to draw conclusions about things from studies with small sample sizes.</p> <p>Later that evening, Srishti and I dragged all of my stuff over to the corporate housing apartment(1) that had been booked for my first month in NYC. Now, corporate housing can be a double edged sword. It is a great source of comfort when you land. It is also a great source of discomfort when you start looking for apartments and realise that you have a ways to go before you can afford to live in that sort of style, or space. In any case, by my second night in the fancy apartment, I missed Singapore so much that I walked about a kilometre away in pouring rain(2) to the only establishment in NYC that made me feel like I was back in Singapore for a little bit - Shake Shack. And I'm pleased to report that the Shake Shacks here are just as good as the ones in SG.</p> <ol> <li>splendid digs located at Liberty View, Battery Place</li> <li>I put on my ski jacket and took advantage of its waterproofness (waterprooficity? I don't wanna say water resistance)</li> </ol> <p>The next two weeks passed by in a blur denser than the fog that envelopes your glasses when you get out of an air conditioned car. I learnt quite a few things in those two weeks. I learnt that people jabbing themselves with needles in subway cars are not doing it to get their daily dose of insulin, generally. I learnt that setting up a Twitter list(1) called \"NYC\" and filling it up only with Fire Department and Police Department tweets is a great way to turn into Chicken Little's distant Indian cousin. I also learnt that you develop peripheral vision rather quickly if you have the aforementioned Twitter list and look at it every 20 minutes(2). Lastly, (and this is something that affected me more than it should've) I learnt that Manhattan doesn't have any decent Chinese food.</p> <ol> <li>for the uninitiated, a Twitter list is basically a feed with specific Twitter accounts</li> <li>hey, I have better peripheral vision    now. That's a win in my book</li> </ol> <p>There were more learnings (some quite major), which will come in a second piece, so stay tuned!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/22/observations/","title":"Second Despatch (Two Years Later)","text":"<p>I guess the first two years were destined to have just one despatch. To be honest, I aimed for this one to come out not long after the first one (I started writing this piece on the 22nd of July, 2023). So, I figured, might as well continue writing it. </p> <p>But my moving finger did not write(1), and thus, did not move on. I've left the original bit of writing as-is, and have made annotations to it in the sidenotes. Please, enjoy.</p> <ol> <li>type, if we're being pedantic. If Omar Khayyam ever comes to know that I'm twisting his poignant couplets to get    eyeballs on the    internet, he will rise from his grave to have some words with me.</li> </ol> <p>In terms of overall well-being - I'm good. Busy(1) and good. I've gotten used to this city's rhythms. I did realise fairly early on in my stint that NYC has a pretty solid PR racket going on. This piece will from time to time, crib about things that the PR machinery very conveniently keeps out of the news. When I'm sitting in the Q train and hear the conductor make a sudden announcement saying hello, this is not the Q train anymore, this is actually the F train, I don't flinch. I stay seated, because muay thai has taught me not to show weakness to anyone(2), least of all to the first city I've encountered that has a non-deterministic subway system.</p> <ol> <li>I was a sweet summer child when I wrote this in 2023. Having spent every saturday    of the past year in school, getting a part-time degree, I can say I'm busy now</li> <li>muay thai also taught me how to injure    myself in July 2023-ish, and I haven't kicked a bag since.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>When I'm sitting in a bus going somewhere, and a Kramer-esque fella pitches me a nice scheme and hands me his business card, I smile and take it, promising to get in touch with him soon. If I see human excrement on the streets, I walk by, with the best air of nonchalance I can muster.(1)</p> <ol> <li>I've seen more human poop on the street here in 7    months than I did in India in 18 years.</li> </ol> <p>There's also the fact that looking for places to rent here can quickly teach you what the word \"absurd\" truly means. Here's one instance - remember that episode in HIMYM, where Marshall and Lily's apartment turns out to be crooked? Remember how when you first saw the damn ep, you chalked it down to the writers' table in the show smoking really high quality stuff, writing something over-the-top in the way only HIMYM writers did? So back in Feb I found an apartment in a great location in the West Village, for really cheap, the only problem being the small(1) bedrooms. I figured there was a catch - small bedrooms are, after all, de rigeur in this town. What else was it that kept the price so low? Upon reaching for my viewing, I entered the apartment, and after a while said out loud (within earshot of the realtor), \"Is it just me, or is the floor tilted?\", thinking, why would an apartment with a tilted floor ever be thought fit to exhibit to prospective tenants? The realtor just shrugged and said, \"it's an old building\". Oh well. Looked through a bunch of apartments(2), and managed to find decent digs in the end.</p> <ol> <li>imagine the standard 4 foot by 2 foot trench that infantrymen generally dig at the end of a long, hard day</li> <li>around forty-ish</li> </ol> <p>Sorry, didn't mean to come off as someone who changed cities to provide himself with the spice of life(1) only to be mad about the spice he encountered. I was, and remain, a spice enthusiast. I love that there's a world out there for me to explore.</p> <ol> <li>i.e., variety</li> </ol> <p>Changing cities is the best way to provide yourself with variety(1). Having changed cities about 10 times in my 26-year life(2), I'd say I'm somewhat of a spice enthusiast by now. Spice is addictive. It is physically and mentally painful. It numbs your senses, brings excitement to your life, teaches you about regret, and sometimes it gives you a nice story to tell to people at dinner. All in all, it's not too bad. I will say though that after eating too much sichuan food over a week in Singapore, I cannot really deal with regular spice very well. Metaphorical spice though? Bring it on. </p> <ol> <li>an overrated spice of life</li> <li>man, I'd started writing this piece when I'd just turned 26, and now I'm roughly 3 months out from 28. Time flies.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>I've done a lot since the last despatch. Went to Italy for the first time - did 11 cities in 11 days: Rome, The Vatican, Palermo, Cefalu, Trapani, Erice, Bari, Matera, Alberobello, Monopoli, Florence. Got into eating clean and lifting weights(1). Visited Rio and its gorgeous beaches.  Tried to learn skiing. Took an elementary spanish class. Saw my cousin married off in Allahabad.
