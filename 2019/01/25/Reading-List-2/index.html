K. Rowling - Short Stories from Hogwarts</a></h4><p>While the Harry Potter series was good, there were always some characters one wished to know more about. Professors McGonagall and Lupin, for example. This book gave me just enough backstory about those characters, without ruining the canon (which is something Rowling’s been doing a lot of).</p><h4 id="cal-newport---so-good-they-cant-ignore-you"><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/0349415862">Cal Newport - So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a></h4><p>This is the perfect build-you-up book that you can read.

Following one’s passion is incredibly bad advice, and Newport explains why in several steps.</p><h4 id="major-robert-crisp---brazen-chariots"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brazen-Chariots-Robert-Crisp/dp/055324163X/ref=tmm_mmp_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Major Robert Crisp - Brazen Chariots</a></h4><p>This is a MAN.

He can be best described in this set of numbers, as mentioned in his obituary in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/05/the-spin-bob-crisp-amazing-life">The Guardian</a> -</p><blockquote><p>The first would be <em>two</em>, which was the number of times Crisp climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. The next would be <em>three</em>, which is both the number of books he wrote, and the number of occasions on which he was busted down in rank and then re-promoted while he was serving in the British Army. Then there are <em>six</em>, which is the total number of tanks he had shot out or blown up underneath him while serving in North Africa, and <em>29</em>, which is the number of days in which all those tanks were lost; <em>24</em> is the number of years he lived after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.
