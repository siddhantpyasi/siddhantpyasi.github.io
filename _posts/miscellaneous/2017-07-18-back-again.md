I'm back, writing my second post for this blog.

This post puts my blog on track to become officially more successful than my Medium profile, where I wrote two posts (and a few comments).

I'm writing this at an unearthly hour, in keeping with the tradition of writing posts after 0100hrs. I think that after 0100, my brain becomes incapable of doing anything productive, which is why I turn to fiddling with my website. I changed the pattern of the footer, and also changed the URL structure, in keeping with what Damon Bauer said [here](http://damonbauer.me/organizing-jekyll-pages/).

I'm gonna try jazzing up the site, by creating a new theme for it. Let's see how that goes.

My flight to Delhi leaves on the 30th of July, so I don't really have a lot of time here.
