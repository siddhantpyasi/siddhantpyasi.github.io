After finding myself lost a bit too many times about the whole India-China border episode, I decided to educate myself on the subject. Because I'm a chap who likes to do the world a bit of good, I have decided to pass on my very vast knowledge to you, dear reader. 

Let's begin, then. There's a lot of reading involved, and if you're not the reading type, too bad. The following resources were used:

1. [Bertil Lintner - China's India War](https://smile.amazon.com/Chinas-India-War-Collision-Course/dp/0199475555)
2. [Claude Arpi's - The Sino-Indian Boundary Issue](http://www.claudearpi.net/the-sino-indian-boundary-issue)
3. [Shivshankar Menon - Choices](https://smile.amazon.com/Choices-Shivshankar-Menon/dp/0143429116/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=shivshankar+menon+choices&qid=1591017729&s=books&sr=1-1)
4. [The Henderson-Brooks, Bhagat Report](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TopSecretdocuments2.pdf)
5. And this wonderful website called [China-India Border Dispute](https://chinaindiaborderdispute.wordpress.com/articles-on-sino-indian-border-dispute/)


Because this is a blog post, it is not going to be excessively detailed. But it will have all you need, and more.
