I did write out a separate post listing the books I read in 2019, but I was too lazy to fill in my thoughts about them, so that one is just a nice list of the books I read, minus my thoughts. Which is why, this year, I'm going to record what I thought about a book immediately after I read it. So here goes  

#### [Bill Carter - The War for Late Night: When Leno Went Early and Television Went Crazy](https://smile.amazon.com/War-Late-Night-Early-Television/dp/0452297494)  
If you're a frequent watcher of Leno/Letterman/Conan clips on YouTube, you'll always come across some pretty bitter viewers who weigh in with their opinions on these hosts. What's more, quite a few of them talk about how Leno screwed over Conan, and I wanted to know more about that. That was when I came across this. A well-written book, if there ever was one, about the whole affair. It gives you the entire sequence of events, from the very beginning - all that you need to know, and more.  


#### [James Crabtree - The Billionaire Raj](https://smile.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064)  
The more I read, the more I like nuance. And this is an incredibly nuanced book describing India's version of the [Gilded Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age). It has so many great observations about India, that it's hard to list them all down. An especially good one is this one, about India's governing machine  
> Inside the machine, it was amateurism rather than authoritarianism that appeared to be the greater threat to Indiaâ€™s future.  

How true! India's governing structure can be amazingly efficient when it has to be, and amazingly inefficient when it doesn't want to step up (or rather, inefficient because amateurs are in charge and don't know _how_ to step up).
