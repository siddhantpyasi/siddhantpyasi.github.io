I've realised that the NCERT Maths textbooks had a sufficiently high standard, that we weren't really aware of back in Class 12.

When you try to download an entire textbook from the [NCERT Website](http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm), the website gives you a ZIP file containing each chapter. 

I've assembled all the chapters of each book in one, easy to use PDF file. Here they are:
* [Class 11 Maths](assets/documents/11Maths.pdf)
* [Class 12 Maths Part 1](assets/documents/12Maths1.pdf)
* [Class 12 Maths Part 2](assets/documents/12Maths2.pdf)

The copyrights of these textbooks belong to the NCERT.
