What Wodehouse would call a “concatenation of circumstances” had occurred, and it meant that I marked my arrival to the New World by being cataclysmically sick mere metres<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">still on the metric system, thank god</span> after I stepped off the plane<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>.<span class="sidenote successive">that’s right, I couldn’t even make it to the nearest washroom</span> I blame the fish served on the plane, my mother on the other hand says this is how I lay announce my arrival to inhabitants of foreign lands. Both of us have sufficient empirical evidence to buttress our claims - I know that fish have never been great fans of my gut; I also know that <em>several</em> new-to-me places have had the good fortune of being decorated with the contents of my stomach<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"><span class="sidenote">A screening of <em>Koi Mil Gaya</em> (2003), Simla (2004), Shillong (2009), Ladakh (2017)</span></span>. In any case, the 18-hour plane ride was not comfortable, I was unable to sample any of the food Singapore Airlines is famous for (apart from the fish of course), and I arrived at my sister’s<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"><span class="sidenote successive">her name is Srishti</span></span> apartment a sweaty, dehydrated husk of a man.</p><p>You know when you think you know what a term means, and then someone conducts a demo for you, and only then do you truly <em>internalise</em> what the term truly means? Well, my arrival was God’s way of demonstrating to me why the word “projectile” is present in the term “projectile vomiting”.</p><p>Anyway, moving on. By this time in an article about arriving at a new place, writers of a certain variety would have used the next few paragraphs to describe their interaction with the fairly chatty taxi driver who drove them, and tried to draw a nice pithy conclusion about the state of the world from the said interaction. Yours truly, however, was, a) driven by a driver who didn’t say a single word throughout the ride, and b) was taught statistics by the formidable <a href="https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/rosie-ching-2211" target="_blank">Rosie Ching</a>, so he knows what happens when one tries to draw conclusions about things from studies with small sample sizes.</p><p>Later that evening, Srishti and I dragged all of my stuff over to the corporate housing apartment<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"><span class="sidenote">splendid digs located at Liberty View, Battery Place</span></span> that had been booked for my first month in NYC. Now, corporate housing can be a double edged sword. It is a great source of comfort when you land. It is also a great source of discomfort when you start looking for apartments and realise that you have a ways to go before you can afford to live in that sort of style, or space. In any case, by my second night in the fancy apartment, I missed Singapore so much that I walked about a kilometre away in pouring rain<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span> to the only establishment in NYC that made me feel like I was back in Singapore for a little bit - Shake Shack. And I’m pleased to report that the Shake Shacks here are just as good as the ones in SG. <span class="sidenote">I put on my ski jacket and took advantage of its waterproofness (waterprooficity? I don’t wanna say water resistance)</span></p><p>The next two weeks passed by in a blur denser than the fog that envelopes your glasses when you get out of an air conditioned car. I learnt quite a few things in those two weeks. I learnt that people jabbing themselves with needles in subway cars are not doing it to get their daily dose of insulin, generally. I learnt that setting up a Twitter list<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span> called “NYC” and filling it up only with Fire Department and Police Department tweets is a great way to turn into Chicken Little’s distant Indian cousin.<span class="sidenote">for the uninitiated, a Twitter list is basically a feed with specific Twitter accounts</span> I also learnt that you develop peripheral vision rather quickly if you have the aforementioned Twitter list and look at it every 20 minutes<span class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>.<span class="sidenote">hey, I have better peripheral vision now. That’s a win in my book</span> Lastly, (and this is something that affected me more than it should’ve) I learnt that Manhattan doesn’t have any decent Chinese food.</p><p>There were more learnings (some quite major), which will come in a second piece, so stay tuned!</p><p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/lDojqc8WeegAAAAC/bombshell-clarkson.gif" alt="Thank you!" /></p><hr> <!-- p>Editors of this piece: </p --><p><a href="/blog">← Back to all articles</a></p></article></main><div class="bottom-footer"> <span class="mini-note">© 2025 Siddhant Pyasi</span></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ extensions: ["tex2jax.js", "TeX/AMSmath.js"], jax: ["input/TeX", "output/SVG"], }) </script> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.6/MathJax.js?config=default"> </script>
