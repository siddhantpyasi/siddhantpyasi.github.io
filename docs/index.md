Hi, I'm Sidd. I graduated from [Singapore Management University](https://smu.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, where I read
Finance and Information Systems on
the [Dr. Goh Keng Swee Scholarship](https://abs.org.sg/dr-goh-keng-swee-scholarship){:target="_blank"}. In my spare
time, I play golf, read about history (chiefly automotive, financial and military), and play the guitar.

Here's my [resume](assets/sidpyasi.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

If you'd like to reach out to me, [email](mailto:sidd@pyasi.net) is ideal.
