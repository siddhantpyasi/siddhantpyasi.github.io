On a humid August in the year 1910, Babulal Pyasi came into this world. Not much is known of his early life, apart from 
the fact that his father had passed away because of the plague, which resulted in the ill-treatment of Babulal's mother 
at the hands of her only brother-in-law (1).

1. one assumes this is because the brother-in-law was eyeing their property (they had several acres of land, which was later taken over by the government to build the [Government Medical College, Jabalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netaji_Subhash_Chandra_Bose_Medical_College){:target="_blank"})
