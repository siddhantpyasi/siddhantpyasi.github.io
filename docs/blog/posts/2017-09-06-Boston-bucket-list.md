I'm on exchange here at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), and here's my bucket list of things to do in Boston over the next four months!

* ~~Do the [Freedom Trail](http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/index.html)~~
* Have Boston cream pies at the place where they were first made, the [Omni Parker House](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/boston-parker-house/dining/boston-cream-pie).
* ~~Catch a Boston Red Sox Game.~~ _DONE! Saw them lose to the Toronto Blue Jays (10-4). Also, University students get $9 discounted tickets._
* ~~See the USS Constitution. _Partially done. I saw her cannon fire a shot at sunset on the 5th of September 2017._~~ _Completely done. Went aboard her, and saw her in all her glory. Also went to the USS Constitution Museum_
* ~~See the Bunker Hill Monument~~ _Saw it in 2024_.
* Catch a Boston Bruins game.
* ~~Catch a Boston Celtics game~~ _DONE! Celtics lost to the Detroit Pistons 108-118_.
* Catch a New England Patriots game.
* Go see [Shear Madness](https://shearmadness.com/)
* Visit the [Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.mfa.org/)
* ~~Visit the [Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/)~~ _I went back to visit it much later, in 2023._
* ~~See the [Boston Philharmonic Orchestra](http://www.bostonphil.org/)
  perform~~ _Saw the [Boston Pops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Pops_Orchestra) perform for christmas. Their version of the [twelve days of Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIDoNopD5RI) is simply amazing_.
* Go kayaking on the Charles River. _The season for that has passed (sort of). So that's one thing that won't happen_
* ~~Check out [Fort Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Independence_(Massachusetts))~~ _Saw it in 2024_.

I'll keep adding stuff to this list as more things occur to me! If I'm missing anything, let me know via Twitter or Facebook (links at the bottom of the page).

__UPDATE:__ Yeah, didn't do quite a few of these. I'll be back someday to check these off, though! *Went back in 2023 and 2024 and ticked off some more!*
