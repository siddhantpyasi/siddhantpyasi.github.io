Hello World!

This is my first blog post.

I am currently in Atlanta, interning at [CompetitorPro](https://www.home.competitorpro.com){:target="_blank"}. I write crawlers by day and try to wrap my head around Rails by night, with the help of [Michael Hartl's](https://www.michaelhartl.com/) awesome [tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/).

There are only 11 more days to go for my internship to end, and then I'll be off to Delhi. I'll be back in the fall to study at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). I'm hoping it won't be too cold.

I ran 1.5 miles non-stop today, and it felt great. I also did 10 push-ups, which is 10 more than I normally do. That's all for this post, I'm really tired now.
