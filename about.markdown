Hi, I'm Siddhant (you can call me Sid, if that's easier to pronounce). I graduated from [Singapore Management University](https://smu.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, where I read Finance and Information Systems. In my spare time, I play golf, read about history (chiefly automotive, financial and military), and play the guitar.  
  
To mark the new decade, I decided to port over [Wordpress' Twenty Twenty Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/){:target="_blank"} to Jekyll.  

Here's my [resume](assets/sidpyasi.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  

If you'd like to reach out to me, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elSidCampeador) or [e-mail](mailto:siddhantpyasi@yahoo.co.in) are ideal.
