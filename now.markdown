As of 26 February 2020, I'm in Singapore. I will be here for the foreseeable future, serving out my bond for the [Dr. Goh Keng Swee Scholarship](https://www.abs.org.sg/dr-goh-keng-swee-scholarship).  

For now, my aim is to teach myself the guitar, read lots of books, and have a good time in general.
